Tallywallet helps Engineers understand Money and Banking.

You can use it to create economic simulations, or to enable your applications
with currency exchange and accounting features.

This package
::::::::::::

Tallywallet is a very young project. This package contains the following:

* A Ledger class for double-entry accounting
* An Exchange class to enable currency trading
* `Pre-hoc` calculation of exchange rate gains on currency trading accounts
* Evaluation of the Fundamental Accounting Equation to verify balanced accounts
* A text format for saving Ledgers to file

Requirements
::::::::::::

Tallywallet requires Python 3.4. It uses setuptools_ for installation, but
has no external runtime dependencies.

You may have to `compile Python 3.4`_ yourself if it is not yet available from
your package repository.

Quick start
:::::::::::

Download and unpack the source distribution::

    $ tar -xzvf tallywallet-common-0.001.tar.gz
    $ cd tallywallet-common-0.001

Run the tests::

    $ python3.4 -m unittest discover tallywallet

Consult the documentation::

    $ firefox tallywallet/common/doc/html/index.html

Roadmap
:::::::

Tallywallet's mission is to provide a validated Pythonic framework for money
trading and economic applications.

It is developed by a private individual but released to the public under the
`GNU Affero General Public License`_.

The API may change significantly as the project proceeds. At this early stage,
you should only use the latest release, which may not be compatible with
previous versions.

Next release
============

The next release will provide an example of a macro-economic simulation using
balanced accounting methods.

Can you help?
=============

* If you've spotted a bug in Tallywallet, please let us know so we can fix it.
* If you think Tallywallet lacks a feature, you can help drive development by describing
  your Use Case.

In either event, please leave a message on the project's `message board`_.
