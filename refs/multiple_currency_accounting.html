<a name="0"><h2>0. Introduction</h2></a>

Accounting with multiple currencies can be tricky. It is easy enough
to use an exchange rate to translate between different currencies. But
things get less obvious when one takes into account how exchange rates
fluctuate over time.  Multi-currency transactions can incur foreign
exchange gains or losses. How does one account for these, while
respecting the Fundamental Accounting Equation? Do different
accounting methods give different results?  What are their advantages
and disadvantages? Does one need to pick a single reference currency,
and why? And most importantly, how does all of this work?

<p>

As a non-expert, I found it surprisingly difficult to find useful
information on this subject. I searched online, and I also consulted
about fifteen different accounting textbooks in the U.K. and
Canada. Of the few books that mentioned foreign currencies at all,
most contained only a single paragraph on the topic, stating that
foreign currency transactions should be translated to the local
currency. I also studied the foreign currency support in the
accounting software I was using (GnuCash), and I quickly found that
the software did not balance my accounts correctly when multiple
currencies were involved.

<p>

After much frustration and some additional thought and research, I
believe I arrived at an understanding how multiple currency accounting
should work, and why. So I wrote this document as a resource for those
who might be looking for such information.  The information in this
tutorial is a synthesis of what I learned from books, what I learned
from accounting standards such as SSAP 20, and what I figured out by
myself. Since I am not an accounting expert, I am sure that some
incorrect terminology has slipped into this document. If you find a
mistake, I would be happy if you send me a correction.  Aside from
terminology issues, I am reasonably certain that the concepts
described in this tutorial are sound.

<a name="1.1"><h3>1.1. Single-entry accounting</h3></a>

Users of accounting software fall into two main classes: home users
and business users. Most home users are only interested in tracking
<i>assets</i> and <i>liabilities</i>. Assets are what you
<i>own</i> (such as money in your bank account or cash in your
pocket), and liabilities are what you <i>owe</i> (such as the balance
on your credit card account, or money you owe your neighbor). An
<i>account</i> keeps a running total of one particular type of asset
or liability. A <i>transaction</i> is an increase or decrease of the
balance of one or more accounts.

<a href="#Table-1.1">Table 1.1</a> shows an example of single-entry
personal accounting with three accounts. It uses just a single
currency, the Canadian Dollar.  Note that account balances are shown
on yellow lines, and transactions are shown on white lines.  Also note
that in asset accounts, positive numbers mean "more assets", whereas
in liability accounts, positive numbers mean "more liability". Thus,
transferring money from one asset account to another (as on January 12)
leads to an increase in one account and a decrease in the other. But
transferring money from an asset account to a liability account (as in
paying a credit card bill on January 15) leads to a decrease in both
accounts.

<a name="1.2"><h3>1.2. Net worth and equity</h3></a>

A person's <i>net worth</i> is equal to their total assets minus their
total liabilities. In other words, the net worth is the effective
amount of money (and property) they own after compensating for all
outstanding debts. A person's net worth can be negative if the total
liabilities exceed the total assets (this is called "living above
one's means", and is not recommended). In a business context, net
worth is also called <i>equity</i>. We therefore have the first
accounting equation:

<p>
<center>Assets &ndash; Liabilities = Equity.</center>
<p>

Going back to the example from <a href="#Table-1.1">Table 1.1</a>, note
that some transactions, like "get paid" on January 4 and 18, increase
a person's net worth. This is called <i>income</i>. Other
transactions, like "buy food" or "buy books" on January 5, 20, and 23,
decrease a person's net worth. This is called an <i>expense</i>. Still
other transactions, such as "withdraw cash" on January 12 or "pay
credit card bill" on January 15, do not affect the net worth at all.

<p>

The following chart shows the same transactions as <a
href="#Table-1.1">Table 1.1</a>, but this time we also show the net
worth in a separate column.

<p>

Note that the accounting equation "Assets &ndash; Liabilities = Equity" is
not only satisfied by the balances (yellow lines), but also by the
individual transactions (white lines).

<a name="1.3"><h3>1.3. Double entry accounting</h3></a>

Let us promote the equity column from <a href="#Table-1.2">Table
1.2</a> by calling it an "account".  Then <a href="#Table-1.2">Table
1.2</a> is a simple instance of <i>double entry accounting</i>.  The
idea is to keep a separate running total for equity, in addition to
the running totals for assets and liabilities. Each transaction must
be
<i>balanced</i>, which means, it must satisfy the accounting equation. 

<p>

Historically (i.e., before computers were used), one of the
purposes of double entry accounting was to catch arithmetic errors and
data entry errors.  Since each transaction had to be recorded in at
least two places, the results of additions and subtractions could be
double-checked simply by checking whether the accounts were balanced. 

<p>

Today, arithmetic mistakes are no longer a major issue (although data
entry errors still are). However, there is one other important benefit
of double-entry accounting. Namely, it gives a convenient way of
tracking and classifying income and expenses.

<a name="1.4"><h3>1.4. Income and Expenses</h3></a>

For businesses, it is important to keep track not just of assets
and liabilities, but also of income and expenses. For example, a
business needs to classify its income according to source. This is
necessary both for tax reasons (income from different sources may be
taxed differently), and also for business reasons (it helps to
determine which parts of the business are profitable).

<p>

In the asset/liability method of tracking finances, money is classified
according to its <i>location</i>: how much money is in your bank
account, and how much in your wallet? By contrast, in tracking income
and expenses, one must classify money according to its <i>purpose</i>:
how much money did you spend on food, and how much on books? 

<p>

For example, in <a href="#Table-1.2">Table 1.2</a>, the total money
spent on food in the given time period was $135 (namely, $70 on
January 5 and $65 on January 20).  Some of the food was bought with
cash, and some with a credit card.  While these different payment
methods matter from the point of view of assets and liabilities, they
are irrelevant from the point of view of expenses.

<p>

The most convenient way to track income and expenses is to split the
column for "equity" from <a href="#Table-1.2">Table 1.2</a> into
several columns. This is normally done for a fixed time period, for
example, one year (called an "accounting period"). The equity at the
beginning of the time period is called the "initial capital". All
increases in equity since the beginning of the time period are called
"income", and all decreases are called "expenses". We therefore have
the second accounting equation:

<p>
<center>Equity = Capital + Income &ndash; Expenses.</center>
<p>

We will therefore split the "equity" account into three columns called
"initial capital", "income" and "expense". The income and expense
columns can be further subdivided to account for different types of
income and expenses. To keep our example simple, we will consider a
single income account called "salary", and two expense accounts called
"food" and "books".

<p>

As there is no limit to the number of accounts one can have, there is
no limit on the number of different types of income and expenses that
can be tracked using this system. Note that expenses (like
liabilities) are recorded as positive numbers, even though they
contribute to equity negatively. 

<p>

Also note that the "initial capital" account never changes in this
example. In business use, there are other types of capital besides
"initial capital", and some of these other types are changeable. For
example, if somebody invests money in a business (thereby becoming an
owner), then this is considered an increase in capital rather than
income. Thus, in general, there can be more than one capital account. 

<a name="1.5"><h3>1.5. The Fundamental Accounting Equation</h3></a>

Putting together the first and second accounting equations
<p>
<center>Assets &ndash; Liabilities = Equity</center>
<p>

and
<p>
<center>Equity = Capital + Income &ndash; Expenses,</center>
<p>

we obtain the following, which is called the Fundamental Accounting
Equation:
<p>
<center>Assets &ndash; Liabilities = Capital + Income &ndash; Expenses.</center>
<p>

The reader should check that both the yellow and the white rows in <a
href="#Table-1.3">Table 1.3</a> indeed satisfy this equation.

<p>

Remark: "equity" is sometimes called "capital" and vice versa; I am
not really sure of the most correct terminology. In this tutorial, I
will continue to use these terms with their meanings introduced above.

<p>

Remark: Traditionally, accountants did not like to subtract or to use
negative numbers. The accounting equation is therefore often written
as "Assets + Expenses = Capital + Income + Liabilities". The
quantities on the left-hand side of this last equation are sometimes
called <i>activa</i> (Assets and Expenses), and those on the
right-hand side are sometimes called <i>passiva</i> (Capital, Income,
and Liabilities). The reader will easily verify that the two versions
of the accounting equation are mathematically equivalent. Conceptually
and pedagogically, I find the division into <i>location</i> (Assets
and Liabilities) and <i>purpose</i> (Capital, Income, and Expenses)
more useful than the division into activa and passiva. Therefore, in
this tutorial, I will continue to use the version of the accounting
equation that uses subtraction.

<a name="2"><h2>2. Foreign currency accounting issues</h2></a>

<a name="2.1"><h3>2.1. Single-entry foreign currency accounting</h3></a>

Handling foreign currencies in single-entry accounting is very simple.
Each asset or liability account can have its own currency. When
transferring money from one account to another, we simply use the
exchange rate that is in effect at the time of the transfer.

<p>

Suppose you keep two kinds of cash in your pocket: Canadian dollars
(CAD) and U.S. dollars (USD). On January 1, you have CAD 200 and no
U.S. dollars. On January 2, you exchange CAD 120 for USD 100 at a bank
(at the day's exchange rate, which is 1.20 CAD/USD). On January 3, you
spend USD 40 on food.  On January 5, you exchange USD 60 for CAD 75
(at that day's rate of 1.25 CAD/USD). On January 7, you spend CAD 20 on
food. These transactions can easily be accounted for with two asset
accounts:

As the example shows, foreign currencies are easy to account for as
long as you only want to keep track of <i>assets</i> (and it is
equally easy for <i>liabilities</i>). The process of doing currency
transfers with exchange rates can easily be automated in software.

<a name="2.2"><h3>2.2. Double entry foreign currency accounting, the wrong way</h3></a>

Things get more complicated if we also want to keep track of income
and expenses.  To illustrate this, we follow the method from <a
href="#Table-1.3">Table 1.3</a> and add accounts for initial capital
and expenses. (Since there is no income in this example, we don't need
an income account). Because I live in Canada, we will keep the capital
and expense accounts in Canadian dollars. Of course, when there is a
transaction that affects one of these accounts, the amount will have
to be translated to Canadian dollars. To do this, we have to know the
exchange rate on January 3; let us assume for the sake of this example
that this exchange rate was 1.30 CAD/USD, so that USD 40 = CAD 52 on
that day.

<p>

Note that we have recorded each transaction according to the exchange
rate in effect on the date the transaction was made. Remember the
accounting equation "Assets &ndash; Liabilities = Capital + Income &ndash;
Expenses". Please convince yourself that each transaction (white line)
indeed satisfies this equation, if one takes the daily exchange rate
into account. Therefore, the white lines are balanced. 

<p>

So what is the problem? The problem is that the yellow lines are not
balanced. For example, consider the balance for January 7. We started
with CAD 200, and we spent CAD 72 on food, so we should still have CAD
128 in our pocket. Yet, we have CAD 135. So something went wrong:
we gained CAD 7 without any record of it on the "equity" side of the
balance sheet.

The accounting system of <a href="#Table-2.2">Table 2.2</a> violates
the Fundamental Accounting Equation. 

<a name="2.3"><h3>2.3. Foreign exchange gains and losses</h3></a>

The CAD 7 that were "won" in <a href="#Table-2.2">Table 2.2</a> are
called a <i>foreign exchange gain</i>. Such gains are caused by
exchange rate fluctuations between transactions. For example, if you
buy a foreign currency, then sell it later at a higher price, you have
enjoyed a foreign exchange gain. Similarly, if you lose money due to
exchange rate fluctuations, then this is called a <i>foreign exchange
loss</i>.  For accounting purposes, foreign exchange gains count as
<i>income</i>, and foreign exchange losses count as an <i>expense</i>.
What the accounting method from <a href="#Table-2.2">Table 2.2</a>
lacks is a way to track foreign exchange gains and losses.

<p>

The question we need to address is therefore how to calculate foreign
exchange gains and losses, and how to record them, preferably while
keeping the Fundamental Accounting Equation intact.

<p>

Calculating foreign exchange gains and losses is somewhat tricky,
because such gains and losses do not occur during transactions, but
rather in the time intervals <i>between</i> transactions. It is
therefore not immediately clear at what time they should be entered in
the balance sheet. In principle, gains and losses happen every time
the exchange rate changes, whether or not there was a transaction. But
it is clearly not feasible to record them on a continuous basis (for
example, once per second). So there must be a better way. 

<p>

Another potential complication is that the concept of a gain or loss
depends on the "base" currency, and therefore on your point of view.
Suppose you have CAD 150 and USD 100, and the exchange rate changes
from 1.20 CAD/USD to 1.25 CAD/USD. If you are Canadian, then you have
just enjoyed a gain (your equity increased from CAD 270 to CAD
275). But if you are American, then you have suffered a loss (your
equity decreased from USD 225 to USD 220).  This dependency on a base
currency seems necessary, but it is also frustrating, as it seems to
imply that a multi-currency accounting system cannot be "symmetric" in
the way different currencies are treated. (It is in fact possible to
design a symmetric system, as we will see in <a href="#6.1">Section
6.1</a> below).

<a name="2.4"><h3>2.4. Calculating gains and losses through adjustments</h3></a>

In principle, one could account for foreign exchange gains and losses
in the same way one accounts for intractable arithmetic errors: by
adding an "adjusting entry" before each yellow line in <a
href="#Table-2.2">Table 2.2</a>, forcing the balances to obey the
accounting equation. This method is shown in <a
href="#Table-2.3">Table 2.3</a>.

<p>

To calculate <a href="#Table-2.3">Table 2.3</a>, we simply had to look
at each day's balance (yellow line), and force it to satisfy the
accounting equation according to that day's exchange rate. An
adjusting entry was then added to produce the desired numbers. As a
result, the "yellow" (balance) lines are balanced, but the "white"
(transaction) lines are not.

<p>

Note that there was an exchange loss of CAD 3 on January 5. While this
technically is an "expense", we have not created a special "expense"
account for it; instead we have recorded this loss as a "negative
gain". This is in accordance with an accepted accounting principle
that states that exchange gains and losses can be directly offset
against each other.

<p>

The method shown in <a href="#Table-2.3">Table 2.3</a> is undesirable
for several reasons. The main problem is that the additional
"adjusting entries" are themselves not balanced, thus violating the
principle of double entry accounting. This removes a source of
redundancy. In effect, since one constantly has to "force" the
accounts to balance, one can no longer notice the difference between
currency fluctuations and random arithmetical errors.

<p>

Moreover, even if the accounts are in balance at one point, they
continually "go out of balance" as the exchange rate changes, even
while no transactions occur. Thus, adjustment entries should really be
added continuously, rather than once per transaction. This would be an
undesirable thing to have to do.

<p>

Another problem with the adjustment method is that it makes it
difficult to add or change transactions retroactively. Suppose we want
to enter another transaction on January 2. Then all future adjusting
balances (on January 3 and 5) have to be re-calculated. While it would
be possible for a computer to do this automatically, it is not
very elegant and even seems manipulative. Instead of simply
<i>recording</i> transactions, we are now <i>calculating</i>
transactions, and the separation of data entry and analysis seems to
be violated. Cause and effect of individual transactions are difficult
to track.

<a name="3"><h2>3. Foreign currency accounting according to SSAP 20</h2></a>

<a name="3.1"><h3>3.1. Accounting for non-monetary current assets</h3></a>

So if the methods shown in <a href="#Table-2.2">Tables 2.2</a> and <a
href="#Table-2.3">2.3</a> are bad, then how should double-entry
accounting for multiple currencies be done? Before we look at possible
solutions, it is useful to recall how one accounts for the changing
value of non-monetary assets.

<p>

Imagine that you are in the business of buying and selling oil. Let us
assume that oil is a <i>current</i> asset, which means that it can be
easily converted to cash on the market. Therefore, oil should always
be accounted for at its <i>current market price</i>.  (This is
different from <i>non-current</i> assets, such as real-estate, which
are usually accounted for at their historical cost).

<p>

Suppose you buy oil at market prices, and you sell it at market price
plus a profit margin of CAD 5 per barrel. On January 1, you buy 10
barrels of oil at a price of CAD 30 per barrel. On January 2, you sell
2 barrels for CAD 35 each (the market price is still CAD 30). On
January 3, the price of oil increases to CAD 32 per barrel. On January
4, you sell 5 more barrels at CAD 37. We can account for this as
follows:

<p>

There are several things to note in this example. The first remark is
that the green column marked "Inventory" is not an <i>account</i>; it
is simply an informational column recording the number of barrels of
oil we currently own, and their current price. This column does not
usually appear in a company's accounts; it can be kept separately. The
accounts only contain the <i>value</i> of the assets, rather than the
assets themselves.

<p>

Also note that this accounting method clearly distinguishes different
sources of income: CAD 35 of the income is from sales profits (for 7
barrels sold at a profit margin of CAD 5 each), and CAD 16 is from
capital gains (because the price of oil rose by CAD 2 at a time when
you had 8 barrels).

<p>

From the viewpoint of multiple currency accounting, we remark that a
"barrel of oil", while cumbersome to carry in your wallet, might
nevertheless be regarded as a kind of currency. We make the
following observations:

<ul>

<li>All accounts are in CAD. Even though there is another currency
involved, namely "barrels of oil", we do not actually keep any account
in this currency. Our "oil asset" account is kept in CAD. 

<li>Because any fluctuations in the price of oil are recorded in CAD,
they are reflected on the asset side of the balance sheet and also on
the income/expense side. As a result, the accounts are balanced at all
times.

<li>Since the oil asset account is denominated in CAD and not in
barrels, we must separately keep an inventory of the actual amount of
oil owned, and also of the current market price. This inventory, which
is shown in the green column in the example, is only informational; it
is not part of the account sheet, and does not take part in any
balancing.

</ul>

<a name="3.2"><h3>3.2. The "official" solution: translation to a single currency</h3></a>

Most countries have a code of standard accounting practices that deals
with foreign currency accounting. These can be searched for (and in
some cases, found) on the web. Examples of such documents are SSAP 20
(for Canada and the U.K.) and FASB 52 (for the U.S.). It is my
understanding that these various country-specific documents more or
less all say the same thing. For example, SSAP 20 states:

<blockquote>
 During an accounting period, a company may enter into transactions
 which are denominated in a foreign currency. The result of each
 transaction should normally be translated into the company's local
 currency using the exchange rate in operation on the date on which
 the transaction occurred [...].
</blockquote>

In effect, this means that foreign currencies should be treated
precisely in the same way as non-monetary assets, i.e., they should be
accounted for <i>in the local currency</i>. (As before, we use
Canadian dollars as the local currency in our examples). This means
that, just as the oil account in <a href="#Table-3.1">Table 3.1</a>
was denominated in CAD (and not in "barrels of oil"), the U.S. dollar
account in our foreign currency example should also be denominated in
CAD (and not in USD), when using this accounting method. Currency
gains and losses are determined in the same way as other kinds of
capital gains and losses: namely, by re-valuing accounts when a change
of exchange rates occurs.

<p>

We illustrate this by reconsidering the example from <a
href="#Table-2.1">Tables 2.1</a>&ndash;<a href="#Table-2.3">2.3</a>,
using the SSAP 20 method. Note that the accounting principle used here
is very similar to <a href="#Table-3.1">Table 3.1</a>.

<p>

Compare this carefully to <a href="#Table-2.3">Table 2.3</a>. The
first thing to notice is that each white and yellow row is balanced in
<a href="#Table-3.2">Table 3.2</a>, which was not the case in <a
href="#Table-2.3">Table 2.3</a>. On the equity side of the balance
sheet (to the right of the solid black line), nothing has changed
(except the order of some transactions). On the assets/liabilities
side (to the left of the solid black line), the USD account is now
denominated in CAD, and therefore, the currency fluctuations on
January 3 and 5 lead to re-valuations of assets.  As in <a
href="#Table-3.1">Table 3.1</a>, the green column is only
informational and should be disregarded for balancing purposes.

<p>

We summarize the main points of the SSAP 20 method:

<ul>
<li>There is always one special <i>reference currency</i>,
typically "the company's local currency".
<li>All accounts are kept in the reference currency. 
<li>Tallies in non-reference currencies are only informational, and do
not take part in balancing.
<li>Fluctuations in the relative values of non-reference currencies
are reflected immediately in their corresponding asset accounts (and
also in a currency gain/loss account).
</ul>

The advantages of this method are:

<ul>
<li>Since all entries are in one currency, no special software support
for multiple currencies is needed &mdash; in principle, only single-currency
accounting software is required.
<li>The accounts are balanced.  
</ul>

The disadvantages are:

<ul>
<li>Separate "tallies" of foreign currencies and their exchange rates
must be kept (the green columns in the examples). In fact, these
"tallies" contain original (<i>source</i>) information, whereas the
corresponding asset/liability accounts contain derived
(<i>calculated</i>) information. In a sense, the foreign currency
accounts that are kept in a local currency are only "virtual"
accounts, whose contents are entirely calculated.

<li>Accounts must be re-valued periodically, and the question arises
when to do this. In principle, this should happen just before every
transaction, and just before generating a report. If there are many
foreign currency accounts, this can mean a lot of (manual) work.

<li>It is relatively difficult to add or change a transaction
retroactively. If new a transaction is entered for an earlier date,
then all future currency gains and losses must be recalculated. This
changes future transactions, not just future balances.

<li>There is an unsatisfying asymmetry in this accounting method,
because one currency must be given prominence above all others.
</ul>

The first three of these disadvantages can be alleviated by using
software that supports the SSAP 20 accounting method. In this case,
the user only has to enter the data from the green columns, and the
software is able to take care of conversions, re-valuations, and
calculating the corresponding gains and losses. 

<a name="4"><h2>4. Foreign currency accounting using currency trading accounts</h2></a>

<a name="4.1"><h3>4.1. Restoring symmetry to foreign currency accounting</h3></a>

In <a href="#3">Section 3</a>, one of our main complaints about the
SSAP 20 accounting method was that it introduces an apparent asymmetry
by requiring one currency to be singled out as the "reference
currency". We would prefer to work with accounts that are directly
denominated in multiple currencies, but we have seen in <a
href="#2">Section 2</a> that this leads to problems with the
accounting equation. Let us now investigate a method that restores
symmetry while also respecting the accounting equation.

<p>

Consider the following simple scenario. On January 1, you have assets
of CAD 60 and USD 100, and the exchange rate is 1.20
CAD/USD. Therefore, your total capital, in Canadian dollars, is CAD 60
+ CAD 120 = CAD 180. Let us assume that you do not make any further
transactions in January, but the exchange rate changes to 1.30
CAD/USD, 1.25 CAD/USD, and 1.15 CAD/USD on the three days following
January 1. Recording only balances (yellow lines) and ignoring
transactions (white lines) for the moment, we find that we should
record the following, more or less in the style of <a
href="#Table-2.3">Table 2.3</a>:

<p>
<a name="Table-4.1"><b>Table 4.1: Cumulative exchange gain as a function of exchange rate</b></a>

<p>

Note that the only change from day to day is the exchange gain; there
are no changes in the asset accounts or in the initial capital
account. Also note that the accounts are balanced on each day, if one
takes that day's exchange rate into account.

<p>

Now let us save some work by giving a <i>formula</i> for the exchange
gain, instead of calculating it explicitly each day. Let the exchange
rate on a given day be <i>x</i> CAD/USD, and let
<i>y</i> be the corresponding exchange gain.  What is the formula for
<i>y</i> in terms of <i>x</i>? We must satisfy the Fundamental
Accounting Equation "Assets &ndash; Liabilities = Capital + Income &ndash;
Expense", and therefore we must have:

<p>
CAD 60 + <i>x</i> * USD 100 = CAD 180 + <i>y</i>.
<p>

This can easily be solved for <i>y</i>:

<p>
<i>y</i> = <i>x</i> * USD 100 &ndash; CAD 120. 
<p>

In other words, the exchange gain <i>y</i> on any given day is exactly
equal to the current value of (USD 100 minus CAD 120), expressed in
Canadian dollars.  We can simplify <a href="#Table-4.1">Table 4.1</a>
by expressing the exchange gain as a difference of multiple
currencies, rather than expressing it as a value in a single currency.

Note that the exchange gains shown in <a href="#Table-4.2">Table
4.2</a> are exactly identical to those shown in <a
href="#Table-4.1">Table 4.1</a>, given each day's exchange rate. For
example, on January 3, <a href="#Table-4.2">Table 4.2</a> shows (USD
100 &ndash; CAD 120), but this is equal to the amount of CAD 5 shown
in <a href="#Table-4.1">Table 4.1</a>, given that day's exchange rate
of 1.25 CAD/USD.

<p>

By expressing exchange gains in terms of multiple currencies, we have
not altered the <i>substance</i> of what has been recorded. We have
only changed the <i>method</i> of recording. 

<p>

Note that each line of <a href="#Table-4.2">Table 4.2</a> is
<i>balanced</i>, independently of the current exchange rate. Indeed,
the entries of each currency are balanced separately: we have CAD 60 =
CAD 180 &ndash; CAD 120, and also USD 100 = USD 100.

<p>

It is important to note that a currency trading account does not
represent <i>assets</i>. The purpose of a currency trading account is
to calculate foreign exchange gains and losses. By convention, gains
are recorded positively and losses negatively, and therefore a
currency trading account is a kind of <i>income</i> account.

<p>

Currency trading accounts are different from any other account in that
they are denominated in two (or more) currencies. Typically, one of
these currencies is your "reference" currency, and the other one is in
the usual terminology called a "security". Thus, in the above example,
we may say that the USD trading account holds "securities" of USD 100,
which are offset by CAD 120 in negative "currency".

<p>

A currency trading account reflects currency exchanges made in the
past, and in an ideal situation where exchange rates never change, its
balance is supposed to be zero. However, as the exchange rate
fluctuates, so does the value of the currency trading account, and
such fluctuations correspond exactly to currency gains and losses. At
the end of an accounting period, one may move the actual (<a
name="4.2.realized">"realized"</a>) gain or loss to an income or expense
account denominated in the reference currency.

<p>

Let us now illustrate the use of a currency trading account by redoing
the example from <a href="#2">Sections 2</a> and <a href="#3">3</a>.
We replace the "currency gain" account by a "currency trading" account
between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars.

Note that transactions that do not involve currency conversions (like
"buy food" on January 7) are entered in the usual way for double entry
accounting. Transactions that do involve currency conversions (like
"exchange" on January 2 and 5 or "buy food" on January 3) must go
through the trading account. Conceptually, when exchanging Canadian
dollars for U.S. dollars, we are moving Canadian dollars "into" the
trading account, and an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars "out of" the
trading account. However, there is a sign reversal, so money moved
"into" the trading account is given a negative sign and money moved
"out of" it is given a positive sign. [FIXME: is there a standard
convention for signs on trading accounts?]

in <a href="#Table-2.3">Tables 2.3</a> and <a
href="#Table-3.2">3.2</a>, we note that the need for any periodic
adjustments (as in <a href="#Table-2.3">Table 2.3</a>, January 3 and
5) or for periodic re-valuation of assets (as in <a
href="#Table-3.2">Table 3.2</a>, January 3 and 5) has been eliminated.
Indeed, the value of the trading account is "self-adjusting", because
it is sensitive to exchange rates.  Since no manual adjustments or
re-valuations are needed, the question of
<i>when</i> to record them becomes a moot point.

<p>

Another consequence of the self-adjusting nature of currency trading
accounts is that there is no penalty for entering or changing
transactions retroactively. Unlike in the SSAP 20 system, where
retroactive transactions have an effect on future transactions and
balances, in the currency trading account system, retroactive currency
transactions only affect future balances (and not future
transactions). In this respect, their effect is no different from
other retroactive transactions.

<p>

Also note that, when using the currency trading account method as in
<a href="#Table-4.4">Table 4.4</a>, there is no need to keep a separate
"tally" or "inventory" of foreign currency assets, as we had to do
using the SSAP 20 method in <a href="#Table-3.2">Table 3.2</a> (green
column). Instead, the foreign currency assets are held directly in an
account.

<p>

Another advantage of the currency trading account method is that it
provides some flexibility in tracking income and expenses from currency
exchange. For many applications, it will be sufficient to have just a
single currency trading account. But it is also possible to have
several such accounts, for instance, one account for each foreign
currency, or one account for each branch of your business, or one
account for each customer. This makes it possible to keep track of
foreign exchange gains and losses attributed to different sources.

<p>

There is no reason that a single currency trading account has to be
limited to two currencies. It is possible to set up a currency trading
account to account for gains and losses from trades between
three or more currencies. The balance in such an account is expressed
as a sum or difference of amounts from each of the participating
currencies.

<p>

Here is a summary of the main advantages of using currency trading
accounts for multi-currency accounting:

<ul>
<li>Foreign currency transactions are entered in accounts that are
denominated directly in the foreign currency. Thus, the account sheet
contains <i>source</i> information.

<li>Accounts are balanced; all transactions and balances respect the accounting
equation.

<li>Foreign exchange gains and losses do not need to be calculated on
a continuous basis; instead, they can be calculated whenever
convenient (e.g. once per accounting period).

<li>Transactions can easily be entered or changed retroactively,
without causing any change in future transactions.

<li>Foreign exchange gains and losses from different sources can be
tracked independently (see <a href="#4.4">Section 4.4</a> for an example).

<li>There is no "reference" currency and thus no inherent asymmetry in
this accounting method.
</ul>

The most important conceptual facts to remember about currency trading
accounts are the following:

<ul>
<li> The purpose of a currency trading accounts is not to perform
conversions, but to calculate gains and losses.  

<li> The value of a currency trading account does not change during
transactions, but in the time intervals between transactions.  
</ul>

<a name="4.3"><h3>4.3. Equivalence with SSAP 20</h3></a>

The accounting method using currency trading accounts is
mathematically equivalent to methods such as SSAP 20. By this, I mean
that it can be used to generate identical financial reports as those
generated under SSAP 20. Indeed, suppose we were to generate a
financial report from the data in <a href="#Table-4.4">Table 4.4</a> at
the end of January 3.  We have recorded the following balances at the
end of January 3:

<p>

<table border=0 bgcolor=#000000 cellspacing=1>

<tr bgcolor=#ffc0c0>

<td align=right>CAD 200</td>
<td align=right>CAD 52</td>
<td align=right>USD 60<br>&ndash; CAD 68</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>

Using the exchange rate of 1.30 CAD/USD in effect on January 3, we
translate all balances to CAD. Note that USD 60 = CAD 78, and
therefore USD 60 &ndash; CAD 68 = CAD 10. Here is the "translated" balance
sheet:

<p>

<table border=0 bgcolor=#000000 cellspacing=1>

<td align=right>CAD 200</td>
<td align=right>CAD 52</td>
<td align=right>CAD 10</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>

Keeping in mind that a currency trading account is a special kind of
income account representing a foreign exchange gain, the translated
balance sheet is <i>exactly identical</i> to the end-of-day balances
for January 3 obtained from the SSAP 20 method that are shown in <a
href="#Table-3.2">Table 3.2</a>.

<p>

Therefore, after translation to the "reference" currency, both
accounting methods yield identical data and generate identical
financial reports.

<a name="4.4"><h3>4.4. Example: tracking exchange gains and losses by source</h3></a>

Suppose you are a Canadian company selling goods to U.S. customers.
Your books are mostly kept in Canadian dollars, but you invoice your
customers in USD. Your customers are given 10 days to pay after you
send them an invoice, and some additional time may pass until you
receive and deposit their USD check in your CAD bank account. Foreign
exchange gains and losses will occur if the exchange rate changes
between the invoice date and the date the payment is received
and converted to CAD. 

<p>

Suppose that, for some reason, you would like to track foreign
exchange gains and losses on a per-customer basis (for example, you
want to determine whether it would be worthwhile to tighten some customer's
payment terms). This can easily be done by using one currency trading
account for each customer.

<p>

The trading account balances on January 20 show that your interaction
with customer 1 resulted in a foreign exchange gain of CAD 5, whereas
your interaction with customer 2 resulted in a foreign exchange loss
of CAD 30. The fact that a particular foreign currency interaction is
"finished", i.e., there are no outstanding currency exchanges, is
reflected in the fact that the USD balance in the corresponding currency
trading account is 0.

<p>

The same method can be used to track foreign exchange gains and losses
associated with any division of sources that you care to keep track
of. For example, you might want to separate exchange gains and losses
from different parts of your business, or from different countries
(this works even when several countries share the same currency).

<a name="5"><h2>5. Realized and unrealized gains and losses</h2></a>

So far, I have discussed a method for calculating gains and losses
from currency transactions (and by extension, from transactions with
other types of variable-priced assets, such as barrels of oil or
shares of stock).  Such gains and losses are also called <i>capital
gains and losses</i>.  In practice, it is often important to
distinguish between <i>realized</i> and <i>unrealized</i> gains and
losses. One area where this distinction is relevant is taxation:
usually, only realized gains are taxable. The exact determination of
whether a particular gain or loss is realized or unrealized is often
tricky, and the rules vary from country to country. In this section, I
will briefly discuss these issues, and show how they can fit into the
multi-currency accounting method.

<p>

In general terms, when you own a variable-priced asset, market
fluctuations will cause the value of the asset to change over
time. These changes of value are called <i>unrealized</i> gains and
losses as long as you still own the item. When you sell the item, they
turn into a <i>realized</i> gain or loss.  While the basic principle
is simple, the precise rules for when a gain/loss is realized depend
on details of the tax code and accounting practices. In particular, it
is not always obvious how to determine the realized gain or loss when
you sell only part of an asset.

<p>

The calculation of <i>unrealized</i> gains and losses can sometimes require
guesswork, because it depends on the fair market value of an asset
that has not yet been sold.  For assets that are unique and not traded
on a daily basis, such as houses, it is often impossible to determine
their precise value, and it is usually better to account for such
items at their original purchasing price, rather than trying to
re-evaluate them all the time. Some other types of assets, such as
currencies and stock, are easier to evaluate. On the other hand,
<i>realized</i> gains and losses can always be calculated exactly,
because when an item is sold, its exact sales price is known.

<a name="5.1"><h3>5.1. An example from real estate</h3></a>

Let us start by considering a simple example from real estate. Suppose
there are two houses on your street, called House A and House B. The
houses are very similar, but they are on opposite sides of the
street. Let us assume that the two houses have equal or similar market
values at any given time.

<p>

Suppose on January 1, you have $500,000. On February 1, you buy House
A for $100,000. On March 1, you buy House B for $120,000. On April 1,
your real estate agent estimates that, in the current market, each
house is worth $115,000.  At this point, the market price of your two
houses is $10,000 more than what you paid for them, so you have an
unrealized capital gain of $10,000.  More specifically, your
unrealized gain from House A is $15,000, and your unrealized loss from
House B is $5,000. On May 1, you sell House A for $105,000, and you
estimate that House B, which you keep, is also worth $105,000. At this
point, you have a <i>realized</i> gain of $5,000 from House A (and you
may have to pay taxes on this amount, minus any expenses, depending on
the applicable tax laws). At the same time, you also have a total
<i>unrealized</i> loss of $15,000 from House B. On
June 1, you decide to sell House B for $110,000. You now no longer
have any unrealized gains or losses. There is a realized loss of
$10,000 from your sale of House B. Together with the realized gain of
$5,000 from House A, this results in an overall realized loss of
$5,000 for the year.

<p>

Here is how the above scenario can be accounted for in the trading
account model. The units are "CAD" for Canadian dollars, and "HOU" for
houses.

<p>

A number of observations are in order. First, unrealized gains and
losses are implicitly recorded in the trading account, and thus
fluctuate automatically as that account is evaluated at different
times. For example, on March 1, the two houses are valued at $240,000,
and therefore the balance of the trading account (converted to CAD) is
$20,000, corresponding to the unrealized gain up to that day. On April 1,
the two houses are valued at $230,000, and therefore the trading
account balance is worth only $10,000.

<p>

Second, when an unrealized gain or loss becomes realized (on May 1 and
June 1), this is witnessed by an explicit transaction, namely by
moving the corresponding amount from a trading account to an income
account.  The important point is that realized gains and losses are
not calculated implicitly by the accounting system, but must be
explicitly stated by a bookkeeper or accountant. I will argue that
this is a desirable and necessary feature. As the below examples will
show, the calculation of realized gains in many cases depends on local
laws and accounting practices, and it is therefore reasonable that it
should be resolved by a human being. Of course the calculation can
also be automated, but this should then be done by a customizable
rule. 

<p>

There is the question of <i>when</i> a realized gain or loss should be
recorded. In the above example, and in the examples following below, I
recorded it immediately on the date of the sale.  However, if the
number of transactions is large, it might be more convenient to
calculate and record realized gains or losses less frequently. For
example, one might decide to do so only once at the end of each
accounting period.

<p>

If we had been very pedantic, we would have used two different units
of "currency" for houses, for example HOA for quantity of House A, and
HOB for quantity of House B. This is because the two houses, while
similar, are not entirely interchangeable (after all, they are on
different sides of the street!) Had we done this, we would have also
created two separate trading accounts for HOA and HOB, similar to what
was done in <a href="#Table-4.5">Table 4.5</a>. In this case, the
realized gain for House A would have been the <i>total</i> content of
the trading account for House A on May 1 (which would have been
denominated in pure CAD on that day). Similarly, the realized loss for
House B would have been the total content of the trading account for
House B on June 1. In this way, it is possible to avoid doing a
separate "side calculation" for determining realized gains and losses,
at the expense of keeping a larger number of separate trading
accounts.

<a name="5.2"><h3>5.2. Importance of the "identity" of assets</h3></a>

To see why things can get more complicated, let us change the above
real-estate scenario slightly. Suppose you had decided to sell House
B on May 1 and House A on June 1, rather than the other way around
(after all, the houses are very similar). Then on May 1, you would
have sold House B for $105,000, resulting in a realized
<i>loss</i> off $15,000 for House B (compared to a realized
<i>gain</i> of $5,000 in the scenario where you sold House A on this
day). On the other hand, on June 1, you would have sold House A for
$110,000, resulting in a realized gain of $10,000 for House A
(compared to a realized loss of $10,000 in the original
scenario). Here are the accounts for the updated scenario. (The
changes between <a href="#Table-5.1">Tables 5.1</a> and <a
href="#Table-5.2">5.2</a> are shown in <font color=red>red</font>).

At the end of the year, your total realized loss for the two houses is
$5,000, regardless of which of the two scenarios you follow. So
assuming your tax year ends on December 31, it does not matter which
house you sold first. However, things are very different if your tax
year ends on May 15, or if you wait several years before selling the
second house. In this case, the difference for the outgoing tax year
is between a gain of $5,000 (in the first scenario) and a loss of
$15,000 (in the second scenario).
<b>Therefore it matters which house you sold first, even if the houses
are identical!</b>

<a name="5.3"><h3>5.3. The FIFO, LIFO, and adjusted cost base methods</h3></a>

Fortunately, in real estate transactions, there is never any question
about which of several houses you sold. No matter how similar House A
and House B are, they still have different addresses. However, things
are not as simple if you own several units of an asset, such as shares
of stock, that are actually indistinguishable from each other. In
accounting terminology, such indistiguishable assets are called
"fungible" assets.  Let us redo the above example, but using shares
instead of houses. We will also shorten the numbers by three zeros.

<p>

Suppose on January 1, you have $500. On February 1, you buy one share
of some company for $100. On March 1, you buy another share for $120.
On April 1, you check the value of your shares, and you find that they
are worth $115 each, so their total value is $230, or $10 more than
you spent to buy them.  You have an unrealized capital gain of $10. On
May 1, you decide to sell one share for $105. What is your realized
gain at this point?

<p>

The answer is: it depends! This is precisely where the rules differ in
different countries. There are three common cases.

<ul>
<li>Some countries (such as
<a href=http://www.ato.gov.au/businesses/content.asp?doc=/content/59214.htm>Australia</a>)
use the <i>first-in-first-out (FIFO)</i> rule. Under this rule, the
share sold on May 1 will be considered to be the share that was bought
the longest ago, i.e., the one that was bought on February 1. The sale
therefore results in a realized gain of $5. This corresponds to the
first real-estate scenario above (where the first house bought is the
first house sold).

<li>Some countries use the <i>last-in-first-out (LIFO)</i>
rule. As the name suggests, under this rule, the share sold on May 1
will be considered to be the share that was most recently bought,
i.e., the one that was bought on March 1. The sale therefore results
in a realized loss of $15. This corresponds to the second real-estate
scenario above.

<li>Some countries (such as Canada) use a method called the
<i>adjusted cost base method</i> or the <i>weighted average
method</i>. Under this method, the realized gain or loss is computed
based on the average cost of all the shares currently owned. Thus, one
would consider the total number of shares you own (2), and the total
amount you spent on them ($220, also called the <i>cost base</i>). The
average cost of the shares is therefore $110. The sale of one share
for $105 on May 1 will therefore be considered to create a realized
loss of $5. After this, the cost base of $220 is adjusted by
subtracting the sold shares ($105) and also subtracting the realized
losses ($5). The result is $110, which is called the new <i>adjusted
cost base</i>. This represents the total historical cost of the
remaining shares after the sale (not their current value!), and will
be used as the cost base for the next sale.
</ul>

From the above descriptions of the FIFO and LIFO methods, it is clear
that their implementation in the multi-currency accounting model looks
almost exactly like the two real estate examples in <a
href="#Table-5.1">Tables 5.1</a> and <a href="#Table-5.2">5.2</a>. One
just has to replace houses by shares. Of course, there will no longer
be separate asset accounts for "House A" and "House B", but instead a
single asset account for this company's shares. The FIFO example is
shown in <a href="#Table-5.3">Table 5.3</a>, and the LIFO example is
shown in <a href="#Table-5.4">Table 5.4</a>. To complete the examples,
I have once again assumed that the last remaining share is sold on
June 1 for $110.

<p>

For both the FIFO and LIFO methods, there is a non-trivial overhead
involved in calculating realized gains and losses. These calculations
require looking back at the history of shares acquired, figuring out
which ones have already been sold, and then figuring out which of the
remaining shares was the "first in" or "last in", respectively. A
transaction for the realized gains or losses then needs to be created
for each sale. There does not seem to be a convenient way to reduce
this overhead in the FIFO and LIFO methods.

<p>

It turns out that the adjusted cost base method does not have such
overhead. If we account for the above example by the adjusted cost
base method, we end up with the following:

Note that, just like for FIFO and LIFO, each realized gain or loss has
an associated transaction. However, in the adjusted cost base system,
it is possible to calculate the amount of the realized gain or loss
without looking at the entire history of purchases and sales. If you
check the example carefully, you will discover that the adjusted cost
base at any given time is exactly equal to the CAD portion of the
trading account. This is not a coincidence, as the trading account
precisely mirrors the historical cost of shares.  The realized gain or
loss of a sales transaction can therefore be calculated simply by
looking at the trading account balance just prior to the sale. Of
course, this only works if there is a separate trading account for
each kind of shares owned.

<p>

Of course, I am not trying to convince you to use the adjusted cost
base method of accounting. You have to use whichever method is
prescribed by the laws in your country!

<p>

In some countries, realized capital gains are taxed at different rates
depending on how long you have held the asset. In such countries, you
should have more than one income account for realized gains, for
example, one for realized gains taxable at the lower rate, and the
other for realized gains taxable at the higher rate. It is clear that
one cannot use the adjusted cost base method in such situations,
because there would be no notion of "how long" you have held the asset
that you are selling. Instead, you should probably be using the FIFO
method. 

<p>

To further illustrate the adjusted cost base method, it may be useful
to consider a more complicated example. Suppose you start with $1000
on January 1.  On January 2, you buy 100 shares of some stock at $8
per share. On January 3, you sell 50 shares at $9 per share. On
January 4, you buy 50 shares at $10 per share. On January 5, you 
sell 80 shares at $11 per share. Using the adjusted cost base method,
the realized gains and losses are computed on a daily basis as
follows:

<p>

Therefore, under the adjusted cost base system, at the end of January
5, you have had $210 in realized gains for the year, and you will
still own 20 shares at an adjusted cost base of $180.

<p>

It should be remarked that the discussion of accounting rules such as
FIFO, LIFO, and adjusted cost base not only applies to shares, but
also to other types of assets, most notably inventory. When a company
sells its oldest inventory first (or assumes to do so for accounting
purposes), it is effectively using FIFO. When it sells its newest
inventory first, it is using LIFO. If overall prices are rising, then
the LIFO method will result in less reportable income (and therefore
lower taxes). However, according to <a
href=http://www.fool.com/news/2003/03/20/inventory-ins-and-outs.aspx>this
article</a>, the LIFO method is frowned upon outside of the U.S.,
because it rarely makes sense to hoard old inventory.

<p>

While I have discussed capital gains and losses in the context of
variably-priced <i>assets</i>, a similar discussion also applies to
variable-priced <i>liabilities</i>.  For example, suppose that you
need to pay an invoice in a foreign currency. If that currency
decreases in value, then the amount you have to pay also decreases (in
terms of your own currency), and therefore you experience an
unrealized gain. This turns into a realized gain when you actually pay
the invoice. In some countries, like
<a href=http://www.ato.gov.au/businesses/content.asp?doc=/content/59214.htm>Australia</a>,
gains and losses from assets must be reported separately from gains
and losses from liabilities (in Australia, these are called "forex
realisation events" of type 2 and 4, respectively). In such cases, one
should have a separate income account for each type of realized gains
and losses.

<p>

In conclusion, we can say that the multi-currency accounting model can
be used to track realized gains and losses under a variety of
accounting rules. Because realized gains and losses are entered as
transactions, any specific rule, such as FIFO, LIFO, or adjusted cost
base, can be implemented. Each of the systems requires a slightly
different calculation to be done.

<p>

<a name="6"><h2>6. Translation issues</h2></a>

<a name="6.1"><h3>6.1. Independence of viewpoint</h3></a>

In <a href="#2.3">Section 2.3</a>, we had briefly mentioned that the
concept of a foreign exchange gain or loss apparently depends on one's
choice of reference currency. A Canadian person who has assets of CAD
150 and USD 100 will perceive a shift in exchange rates from 1.20
CAD/USD to 1.25 CAD/USD as a gain, whereas an American person in the
same situation will perceive such a shift as a loss.

<p>

In international business, such differences of viewpoint are more than
just "perceptions"; they have real and important financial
implications (for example, gains are taxed, but losses are not). 

<p>

As an example, suppose that a Canadian company has a
U.S. subsidiary. Suppose that the U.S. subsidiary has assets of CAD
150 and USD 100. For simplicity, also assume that the subsidiary has
no transactions throughout the year, that the exchange rate on January
1 was 1.20 CAD/USD, and that the exchange rate on December 31 was 1.25
CAD/USD. Since the subsidiary company is American, its books are
naturally kept in U.S. dollars. Here is what the books would look
like, using the accounting method with a currency trading account:

<p>

When preparing its financial statement for the fiscal year, the
U.S. subsidiary "translates" the opening and closing balances
into USD, using the exchange rate of 1.20 CAD/USD for January 1, and
the rate of 1.25 CAD/USD for December 31. Here is the translation:

<p>

The U.S. subsidiary has therefore suffered an (unrealized) loss of USD
5, and will report this to the Canadian parent company. Here is what
the financial report of the subsidiary might look like:

<p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=1>

<tr>
<td><b>Initial capital (Jan 1):</b></td>
<td align=right>USD 225</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Minus Losses:</b></td>

<td><b>Final capital (Dec 31):</b></td>
<td align=right>USD 220</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p> 

The parent company then has to incorporate its subsidiary's financial
statement into its own books. To do so, SSAP 20 requires that the
parent company translates the subsidiary's statement into its own
reference currency, which is CAD. The parent company will use the
exchange rate of January 1 to translate the initial capital, but will
use the exchange rate of December 31 to translate all income,
expenses, and the final capital. Here is how the parent company might
translate the subsidiary's financial statement:

<p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=1>

<tr>
<td><b>Initial capital (Jan 1):</b></td>
<td align=right>USD 225</td>
<td width=40 align=center>*</td>

<td align=right>CAD 270.00</td>

<td align=right>1.25 CAD/USD</td>
<td width=40 align=center>=</td>
<td align=right>CAD 275.00</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p> 

Note that the addition is correct in U.S. dollars, but not in Canadian
dollars. To fix this, the parent company will now have to add to its
own books a capital gain, because the initial capital of USD 225 of
the subsidiary company, which represents an investment from the point
of view of the parent company, has risen in value from CAD 270 to CAD
281.25 during the accounting period, due to the rise in the value of
the U.S. dollar from CAD 1.20 to CAD 1.25. The parent company must
therefore adjust the translated books of the subsidiary by a capital
gain of CAD 11.25.

<p> 

We note that this capital gain of CAD 11.25 is calculated based only
on the <i>initial</i> capital of the subsidiary company. Also note
that the numbers now add up correctly, both on the subsidiary's side
(where there is no capital gain) and on the parent's side (where there
is a capital gain). The capital gain only exists from the point of
view of the parent company, whose reference currency is CAD. From the
point of view of the subsidiary company, whose reference currency is
USD, there is no visible capital gain. Finally, we note that to do
this translation, the parent company only needs the year-end financial
statement of the subsidiary. It does not need detailed information
about the subsidiary's transactions.

<p>

Now suppose that the Canadian parent company also has a Canadian
subsidiary. Assume, for comparison, that the Canadian subsidiary had
exactly the same amount and type of assets as the American subsidiary,
and that it too did not have any transactions. This second subsidiary
is financially identical to the first one, except that it accounts for
its equity in CAD.  Therefore its books look like this:

Note that the main difference between <a href="#Table-6.1">Tables

carried in a different currency.  This also affects the initial
balance in the trading account. When it comes to preparing the
year-end financial report, the Canadian subsidiary will translate its
opening and closing balances to CAD:

</table>

<p> 

The parent company can incorporate this statement directly into its
books, since it is already in Canadian dollars. 

<p>

What this example illustrates is <i>independence of viewpoint</i>, an
important accounting principle. The end result, from the point of view
of the parent company, is the same, no matter whether the subsidiary
keeps track of its equity in USD or in CAD. In the first case, the
parent will report capital gains of CAD 11.25, which are partially
offset by currency exchange losses of CAD 6.25. In the second case,
the parent will report currency exchange gains of CAD 5.00. The net
gain, in each case, is the same. 

<p>

In summary, it does not matter whether one first translates the books
to a new currency and then prepares a financial report, or whether one
first prepares a report and then translates the report to a new
currency, adding a capital gain or loss on the initial capital.

<p>

In practice, the nationality of a subsidiary can of course make a
difference, for example in the area of taxation.  In the above
example, the U.S. subsidiary reports a net loss, and is therefore not
taxed in the U.S. (however, its Canadian parent is taxed in Canada).
The Canadian subsidiary reports a gain, and it is therefore
potentially taxed in Canada (although in the case we considered here,
it probably won't be taxed, as the gain is unrealized). Any such taxes
are partially offset by lower taxes for the Canadian parent.

<a name="6.2"><h3>6.2. Reference currency vs. Equity currency</h3></a>

Note that <a href="#Table-6.1">Tables 6.1</a> and <a
href="#Table-6.3">6.3</a> make use of trading accounts, and thus, they
use an accounting method that treats multiple currencies in a
symmetric way. There is no "reference currency" in the sense of SSAP
20, because not all accounts are kept in a single currency.

<p>

Nevertheless, there is of course a difference between <a
href="#Table-6.1">Table 6.1</a> and <a href="#Table-6.3">6.3</a>. An
American company will typically record its equity (capital, income,
and expenses) in USD, while a Canadian company will do so in
CAD. Therefore, each company will favor a particular currency.

<p>

However, this particular asymmetry is caused by the way companies
choose to denominate their accounts, and is not built into the
accounting <i>system</i>. There is no reason why, in principle, some
company could not keep some of its income, expense, or capital accounts
in USD and others in CAD. The accounting method with currency trading
accounts would have no problem accommodating this. However, the
preparation of single-currency financial reports would be somewhat
trickier in this case, as capital gains and losses would have to be
added to the reports for foreign-denominated capital accounts (this
can be done by the method shown in <a href="#6.1">Section 6.1</a>).

<a name="7"><h2>7. Specific software</h2></a>

This section provides some pointers to multiple currency accounting
support in specific accounting software packages.

<a name="7.1"><h3>7.1. GnuCash</h3></a>

GnuCash has built-in support for multiple currencies, but prior to
version 2.3.9, its double-entry accounting followed the method
described in <a href="#2.2">Section 2.2</a> ("the wrong way"), with
currency gains and losses calculated by the reporting system. Proper
currency trading accounts could be set up manually, but were not
supported by the exchange rate system, so each transaction had to be
calculated by hand. As of version 2.3.9, support of currency trading
accounts has been added, but is not enabled by default. See
<a href=gnucash.html>Multiple currency accounting in GnuCash</a> for
information on how to enable it, and also for information on the older
"manual" method.
